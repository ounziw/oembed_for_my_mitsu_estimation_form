My Mitsu allows you to put a form into your WordPress website, by filling in a html code, like
&lt;iframe src="..." width="..." height="..."&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

This plugin allows you to output an iframe html tag in a simple way. Simply filling in a url will ouput an iframe html code.

https://my-mitsu.jp/estimation/274 will output &lt;iframe src="https://my-mitsu.jp/estimation/274" id="mymitsu" width="640" height="480"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

The width/height is determined by the $content_width, which is set in your theme. If you plan to change the width/height, you can use a filter hook.
